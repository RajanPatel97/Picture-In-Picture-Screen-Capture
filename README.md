"Picture-in-Picture (PiP), where the video is contained in a separate miniature window that is always on top of other windows. Many users want to continue consuming media while they interact with other content, sites, or applications on their device. A common UI affordance for this type of activity is Picture-in-Picture (PiP), where the video is contained in a separate miniature window that is always on top of other windows. This window stays visible even when the user agent is not visible." - W3C
